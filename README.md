## ðŸš€ Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Converted date/time fields  
   - Created additional time-based columns (`Year`, `Month`, `YearMonth`)  
   - Handled nulls and formatting issues  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Total and average revenue  
   - Hourly, daily, monthly trends  
   - Coffee type performance  
   - Payment preferences  

3. **Visualizations**
   - Line charts for daily/monthly sales  
   - Bar charts for top coffee types  
   - Heatmap for sales by weekday & hour  
   - Comparison of payment types

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Morning (8â€“11 AM) is the busiest period  
- Weekends have slightly higher revenue per transaction  
- Americano and Latte are top-selling coffees  
- Most customers pay via card
